# Python Input and Ouput

## What I learnt
<ul>
<li>Opening a file can be done directly using open() function which takes 2 or 3 arguments. The filename, the encoding and/or mode. Using this method, f.close() must be used at the end or it will take up memory as it can never close itself.</li>
<li>Opening or handling files using "with". This method is preferable because it closes automatically at the end of the action by it read, write, tell and so on</li>
<li>How to read a file line by line using readline(), read full content, write text, knowing how many characters was inputed, knowing the position of cursor and move cursor.</li>
<li>JSON, serialization and deserialization, conversion from python data structure to JSON string and reverse</li>
</ul>
